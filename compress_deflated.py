    zlib.compressobj([level[, method[, wbits[, memlevel[, strategy]]]]])

        Returns a compression object, to be used for compressing data streams that wonâ€™t fit into memory at once. level is an integer from 0 to 9 controlling the level of compression; 1 is fastest and produces the least compression, 9 is slowest and produces the most. 0 is no compression. The default value is 6.

        method is the compression algorithm. Currently, the only supported value is DEFLATED.

        wbits is the base two logarithm of the size of the window buffer. This should be an integer from 8 to 15. Higher values give better compression, but use more memory. The default is 15.

        memlevel controls the amount of memory used for internal compression state. Valid values range from 1 to 9. Higher values using more memory, but are faster and produce smaller output. The default is 8.

        strategy is used to tune the compression algorithm. Possible values are Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY, Z_FILTERED, and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.
